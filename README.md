# Snail Staking and Pearl Points System Documentation
## Proposal:
Develop a staking and rewards calculation system for users, allowing them to earn tokens by participating in staking and holding them for a specific period. The system should ensure fair distribution of rewards based on the amount and duration of staking, and should also account for changes in the total deposit and staking activity of other users. Additionally, the system should calculate "Pearl Points" for each user based on their staking activity.â€¨

## Regulations:
* Users can stake SNAIL tokens with rewards in SNAIL, which will be mined for 2 years.
* The total reward for 2 years will be 2.47% of the total SNAIL token supply (2,000,000,000 tokens).
* Users can stake SNAIL with 7 lock-up period options: 30 days, 45 days, 90 days, 180 days, 365 days, 500 days, and 650 days.
* The longer the lock-up period of a pool, the greater the number of rewards allocated from the total pool reserve.
* Users can make deposits at any time.
* Users have no restrictions on the number of stakes, participation in different pools, or the total amount of staking.
* Users can withdraw their deposit and receive rewards at any time after the lock-up period, including after the farming period ends.
* If a user remains in the pool at the end of the lock-up period, they continue to receive rewards until they withdraw or until the end of the 2-year farming period.
* Staking rewards are paid in tokens based on time and the ratio of the user's stake size to the total deposits in the pool.
* Each user's stake affects their Pearl Point balance, which depends on the stake size and pool multiplier.
* Pearl Points are calculated in real-time and only based on the user's active stakes.
* Administrators can configure the farming period, define pools, add rewards to a pool, set the pool's Pearl Point multiplier, but cannot change these settings afterwards.
* Administrators do not have access to stakers funds and cannot manage the reward funds deposited in the pool.

## Technical requirements:
* Contracts are developed using secure Solidity and OpenZeppelin practices.
* All fund and reward actions occur within smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency.
* Smart contract logic should be clear and transparent, and the code should be publicly available. The code should be accompanied by clear documentation that allows easy understanding of the technical solution and ensures its reliability.
* Any technical possibility of theft of user funds must be excluded, and this must be confirmed by independent auditors.
* Contracts can be easily integrated into an application or service that provides full staking process management for the user, provides them with up-to-date information on active pools, lock-up periods, Pearl Point multipliers, and allows them to see their current Pearl Point balance in real-time.

## Calculations Specifics:

### Staking Rewards Calculation

The system of intervals was used for calculating rewards for each specific user. Intervals in the contract are used to track changes in the stake size and the total amount of stakes in the staking pool. Each interval represents a specific time period during which changes in stakes occurred. These changes may include adding new stakes, increasing or decreasing the stake size, as well as withdrawing stakes. Intervals play a key role in the accurate calculation of staking rewards, taking into account changes in stakes and the total stake volume in the pool.

Intervals influence reward calculation in the following ways:
* Time of stake consideration: Intervals allow for considering how much time has passed since the stake was added until the current moment. This is important for calculating rewards, as staking rewards are distributed proportionally to the time spent staking.
* Total stake volume in the pool consideration: Intervals also allow for considering changes in the total stake volume in the pool. This is important for fairly distributing rewards among all staking participants, considering their contribution to the total pool.
* Acceleration of calculations: Using intervals speeds up reward calculations. Data from intervals allows for quick reward calculations based on changes in stakes over a specific period of time.
* Security: Fixed intervals help avoid potential contract attacks related to memory overflow or abuse with too much data. Since intervals are fixed and managed by the contract, risks associated with them can be minimized.

#### Reward Calculation Case:

Let's consider the following situation as an example: 6 participants of a staking pool start staking at different times (within different intervals) and stay for different durations. Some stakers exit before others enter, some stakers overlap and compete for rewards based on their staking amounts.

The formulaic calculation of rewards for staker will be calculated according to the following principle:

#### Staker 1:

![staker1Rewards.jpg](images%2Fstaker1Rewards.jpg)

This is the formula for calculating the reward for the first staker in the example, who participated in staking during two time periods. The first term takes into account the reward for the first staking period, and the second term represents the additional reward for overlapping with the second staker.

#### Staker 2:

![staker2Rewards.jpg](images%2Fstaker2Rewards.jpg)

This formula considers the partial reward for overlapping with the first staker in the first term, and the full reward for the second staker being alone in the pool during the second period in the second term.

#### Staker 3:

![staker3Rewards.jpg](images%2Fstaker3Rewards.jpg)

This formula calculates the rewards for the third staker over different time intervals, considering the staker's stake amount and its intersections with other stakers in the pool.



### Pearl Points Calculation
The calculation of pearl points in the PearlPointsCalculator contract is based on the user's stake size and the pool multiplier, which is set by the administrator for each pool.
The calculation of pearl points is performed using integer arithmetic to ensure efficiency and avoid floating-point issues. After the calculation, pearl points can be used for various purposes in the Snailbrook system. Pearl points are calculated only based on active stakes.
